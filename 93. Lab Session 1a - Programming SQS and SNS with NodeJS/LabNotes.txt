1) Made LabNotes.txt using method specified in Chapter 92

2) Lab Goals:
    * Create an SQS queue using AWS Node.js SDK
    * Create & send messages to SQS queue (again with the SDK)
    * Process/ Retrieve messages afterwards

3) Paste JavaScript code from page 6 of Lab Notes
    * I wrote it because its a nice reminder

4) go to API documentation page at:
    * https://www.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/

5) Creating the Queue parsed an error, we need to update to AWS SDK v3
    * change directory into cd 93 (tab) to autocomplete
    * install the SQS C3's modular packages  with:
        ** npm install @aws-adk/client-sqs 
    * Edit existing code to accomodate SQS JavaScript v3   
        ** Is more efficient because it only imports necessary modules
        ** Becomes modular as well
