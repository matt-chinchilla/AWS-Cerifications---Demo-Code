1) Goals:
    * Creating an SNS topic

    * Have SQS queue subscrube to that topic
        **Why?:
        ** When messages are published to that topic --> will be picked up in SNS queue
        ** Create Permissions that allow this to happen

    * Write some python that allows me to send SNS messages && publish them to SNS topic

2) Remove Obsolete/Depreceated code
    * tab-out the "create_messages(sqs_queue_url) component in MAIN METHOD
    * Also the print() after

3) Make the SNS Topic in AWS API
    * Leave it all as default
    * Just make a topic name && a display name
    * Create subscription for the sqs queue to access

4) Create a Message for the Topic
    * After making it --> Queue won't pick it up    
        ** Why?: SNS service does not have permission to send messages to queue
    * How to fix:
        ** Go to access policy in SQS
        ** Choose Edit
        ** Fill in appropriate JSON w/:
            *** ARN for SQS queue
            *** ARN for SNS topic

5) Alter create_messages() so that it will pass them to SNS queue in code rather than with API  
    * Remove the parameter of "queue_url"
    * Add new create_messages() fxn
        ** Make sure to add ARN for the Topic in SNS at Topic section of the sns.publish part
