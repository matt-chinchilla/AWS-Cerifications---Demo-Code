1) Goals:
    A) Launch an ElistiCache Redis cluster
    B) Connect to that cluster with my IDE
    C) Use a Redis client to WRITE and READ to that cluster
    
A)  Launch an ElistiCache cluster
    * Make an inbound security group for my VSCode Workplace????
        ** This is why the cancellation of Cloud9 is awful

    * Launch inside of a Subnet Group
        ** Maybe?

B) Connect to the cluster   
    * Clone from the lab using: git clone https://github.com/backspace-academy/aws-elasticache-redis-python
    * Install dependencies
        ** cd aws-elasticache-redis-python
        ** sudo pip install redis
        ** Check differeny python client availability at: redis.io/clients#python
    * Paste the redisEndpoint from the API

C) Writing data to the cluster  
    * write into the redis DB:
        ** My high score, and input an answer of 1000
    ** Becomes imposssible without another EC2 instance of Cloud9 :(
